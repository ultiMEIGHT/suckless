# suckless
Soul pupose of this repo was to make a place for me to dump my Suckless configs to make my life easier when reinstalling.

## Important Disclaimer
I haven't forked the "official" repos, neither have I compiled these utilities in the conventional manner, i.e. clone->compile->install,
instead I have used portage to install em on my system, that's why only a single header file. Nevertheless, feel free to mess around with
them at your heart's content.
